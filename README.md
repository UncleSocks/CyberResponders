##
**CyberResponders** is a terminal-based cybersecurity training game that enables players to respond to different cyber incident scenarios. Here, they have three chances to enter the correct command before the system becomes completely compromised, resulting in a game over! 

The goal of the game is to provide an entertaining way to familiarize users with simulated Windows CMD commands while being in the shoes of an incident responder. 

### Still under deployment, but playable.
